# Project name : two_to_the_n

## Description

A C++ program that computes 2 to the NTH power, where n is very large

## Operating instructions

This project is in full compliance with the MIT License and is legally binding

As you can see, this project is made up of two project files, main.cpp and main2.cpp.

main2.cpp is the main program; main.cpp is invalid and will not run with an error.
The project releases builds that are compiled entirely from main2.cpp and do not have the -O optimizations.

You programmers can optimize according to your compiler

My command: 'g++ -static main2.cpp -o build.exe'
